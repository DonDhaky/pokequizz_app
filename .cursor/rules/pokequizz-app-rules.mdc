You have to be always considering the [package.json](mdc:pokequizz_app/package.json) file to know the current dependencies in the project.
Always provide clean code and beautiful interfaces for the app when building.

You have to be always considering the @package.json file to know the current dependencies in the project.
Always provide clean code and beautiful interfaces for the app when building.

General Priorities
Performance and Fluidity: Ensure the app feels smooth and responsive. Optimize for animations, data fetching, and rendering performance on mobile devices.
When editing design of the app, never edit the structure and the logic of the app.
Security & Best Practices: Always adhere to React Native, Expo, and Supabase security best practices, especially concerning API keys, authentication, and data handling.
Maintainability: Write code that's easy to understand, test, and extend in the future. Follow standard coding conventions consistent with the existing codebase.
Technical Specifics & Code Quality
React Native & Expo:
Utilize functional components and React Hooks.
Leverage TypeScript for type safety in all new and modified code.
Prioritize Expo SDK functionalities. Avoid ejecting from Expo.
Use expo-router for navigation management.
State Management (Zustand):
Manage global application state efficiently using Zustand stores. Keep stores concise and focused on specific data domains.
Ensure proper state updates and avoid unnecessary re-renders.
Backend (Supabase):
Interact with Supabase using its official JavaScript client library.
Handle data fetching, mutations, and real-time subscriptions (if any) efficiently. Protect sensitive data and user information.
Styling & Theming:
Use StyleSheet.create for static, component-scoped styles, consistent with the RecentGames component.
Implement styled-components for dynamic styles, theming capabilities, and creating reusable styled components where more flexibility than StyleSheet is needed.
Refer to the @/utils/theme file for color definitions and maintain consistency with the existing theme.
UI Components:
Build UI using standard React Native components combined with custom components.
Focus on creating a visually appealing and consistent look based on the provided design context and existing code patterns.
Animations (react-native-reanimated):
Implement fluid and performant animations using react-native-reanimated for interactive elements and gestures.
API Integration (PokéAPI):
Handle asynchronous data fetching from PokéAPI gracefully, including loading states and error handling.
Implement client-side caching strategies if large amounts of static data are frequently requested.
Icons (lucide-react-native):
Utilize lucide-react-native for all icon needs, as demonstrated in the RecentGames component. Ensure consistency in icon usage.
Typography:
Use custom fonts from @expo-google-fonts/inter and @expo-google-fonts/poppins defined in your project. Ensure font weights and styles are consistent with the existing UI.
Interaction & Output Guidelines
Clarity and Conciseness: Provide solutions and explanations that are direct and easy to understand.
Code Snippets: When providing code, ensure it's ready to be directly integrated, well-formatted, and includes necessary imports.
Problem Solving: If encountering ambiguity or multiple valid approaches, state assumptions or propose options with justifications.
Design & UX Focus: Always consider the "Desired User Experience" section of the project prompt. Suggest UI/UX improvements or alternatives if they significantly enhance the user experience while staying within the technical constraints and current design patterns.ent design patterns.
